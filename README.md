- 👋 Hi, I’m @bigsean
- 👀 I’m interested in ADA and 508 compliant vanilla javascript projects like splidejs and similar mobile tools. (iOS/objC-Swift/Android-Java)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript all over again. Wow, it's like I'm Rip Van Winkle, Developer from the age of stone tools and bear-skins.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on MapBox, SplideJS, and other projects.
- 📫 How to reach me - meh, not ready for that quite yet.
